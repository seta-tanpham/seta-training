# 🏗 Training Exercise: User, Team & Asset Management

## 🎯 Objective

Build a system to manage users and teams:

- Users can have roles: **manager** or **member**.
- Managers can create teams, add/remove members or other managers.
- Users can manage and share digital assets (folders & notes) with access control.

---

## ⚙ System Architecture

- ✅ **GraphQL service**: For user management: create user, login, logout, fetch users, assign roles.
- ✅ **REST API**: For team management & asset management (folders, notes, sharing).

---

## 🧩 Functional Requirements

### 🔹 User Management (GraphQL)

- Create user:
  - `userId` (auto-generated)
  - `username`
  - `email` (unique)
  - `role`: "manager" or "member"
- Authentication:
  - Login, logout (JWT or session-based)
- User listing & query:
  - `fetchUsers` to get list of users
- Role assignment:
  - Manager: can create teams, manage users in teams
  - Member: can only be added to teams, no team management

---

### 🔹 Team Management (REST API)

- Managers can:
  - Create teams
  - Add/remove members
  - Add/remove other managers (only main manager can do this)

Each team:

- `teamId`
- `teamName`
- `managers` (list)
- `members` (list)

---

### 🔹 Asset Management & Sharing (REST API)

- **Folders**: owned by users, contain notes
- **Notes**: belong to folders, have content
- Users can:
  - Share folders or individual notes with other users (read or write access)
  - Revoke access at any time
- When sharing a folder → all notes inside are also shared

**Managers**:

- Can view (read-only) all assets their team members have or can access
- Cannot edit unless explicitly shared with write access

---

## 🔑 Key Rules & Permissions

- Only authenticated users can use APIs.
- Managers can only manage users within their own teams.
- Members cannot create/manage teams.
- Only asset owners can manage sharing.

| `logout()`                          | Logout current user     |
| `fetchUsers()`                      | List all users          |

### 📌 REST API: Team Management

| Method | Path                                 | Description        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| POST   | /teams                               | Create a team      |

#### ✅ Create team – request body:

```json
{
  "teamName": "string",
  "managers": [{"managerId": "string", "managerName": "string"}],
  "members": [{"memberId": "string", "memberName": "string"}]
}
```

## 🧩 Database Design Suggestion

- Users: `userId`, `username`, `email`, `role`, `passwordHash`
- Teams: `teamId`, `teamName`
- team\_members, team\_managers: mapping tables
- Folders: `folderId`, `name`, `ownerId`
- Notes: `noteId`, `title`, `body`, `folderId`, `ownerId`
- folder\_shares, note\_shares: `userId`, `access` ("read" or "write")

---

## ✅ Development Requirements

- Use JWT for authentication
- Validate role before allowing team creation or manager addition
- Handle errors: duplicate email, invalid role, unauthorized actions
- Write models for User, Team, Folder, Note
- Use Go Framework (Gin)
